## Master's Thesis Code - Assessing the Accuracy and Stability in Grid-Based Areal Interpolation

This repository contains the R scripts used for the build-up and analysis of my Master's thesis, titled Assessing the Accuracy and Stability in Grid-Based Areal Interpolation.

Here is a brief explanation of the files:

The files that start with A,B,C and D represent the four methods used in this thesis,
namely, Binary Dasymetric Mapping, Three-Class Dasymetric Mapping, Areal Weighting and Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial Regression, respectively. 
Attached to these letters, KM represents the 1km x 1km grids, M500 represents the 500m x 500m grids and M100 represents the 100m x 100m grids.

The files with the word Functions in it represent all the functions created to aid the process in the other files.

The file Analysis.Rmd are used to make plots, conduct tests, visualize maps and other actions needed for the thesis.

#### Important Note

The data used in this study are confidential and proprietary to Statistics Netherlands, so they cannot be published. As a result, the code in this repository cannot be executed without access to the original dataset.

Let me know if you have any questions and thank you for reading.
